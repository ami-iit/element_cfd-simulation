# CFD

In this folder are stored all the files related to the CFD simulations performed by Antonello Paolino, starting from the simulations of the flow over the sphere and the iRonCub head, ending to the simulations over the iRonCub whole-body geometry. The outcome is to generate correct parameters to obtain the forces and torques on iRonCub in flight conditions.

## geometries

Here you can find the simplified geometries used for the simulations and other useful files as the automatic-CAD configuration generator script.

## iRonCub

Here are collected all the simulations on iRonCub parts and whole-body simplified geometries.

## sphere

Here the preliminary simulations involving the flow over the sphere are reported for different flow conditions and turbulence models applied.
