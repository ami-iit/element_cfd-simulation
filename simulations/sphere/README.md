## Sphere simulations

In this repo there is a limited amount of all the data collected during [Antonello Paolino](https://github.com/antonellopaolino) [MSc thesis](https://github.com/ami-iit/element_cfd-simulation/blob/master/docs/antonello_paolino_master_thesis.pdf) on aerodynamic drag coefficient of flow around a sphere at transitional Reynolds numbers.
