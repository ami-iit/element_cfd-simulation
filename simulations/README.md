## Simulations

In this repo there are some of the simulation projects and files used for the CFD studies on a simple bluff body as the sphere and the multi-object complex geometry of iRonCub.
in particular in the `ironcub-automatic-cfd` it's possible to find out all the useful files and info to perform automatic CFD simulations on the iRonCub geometry according to the varying input parameters.
